# Enumerating & Retrieving Password Policies

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - Credentialed

We can pull the domain password policy in several ways, depending on how the domain is configured and whether or not we have valid domain credentials. With valid domain credentials, the password policy can also be obtained remotely using tools such as `CrackMapExec` or `rpcclient`.
```

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - SMB NULL Sessions

Without credentials, we can potentially obtain the password policy via SMB NULL sessions or LDAP anonymous binds. SMB NULL sessions allow unauthenticated attackers to retrieve domain information including complete user/group/computer listings, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. These misconfigurations often result from legacy Domain Controllers being upgraded in place, carrying forward insecure default configurations from older Windows Server versions.

Earlier Windows Server versions granted anonymous access to certain shares by default, enabling domain enumeration. SMB NULL sessions are easily enumerated using tools like `enum4linux`, `CrackMapExec`, or `rpcclient`.

We can use `rpcclient` to check Domain Controllers for SMB NULL session access. Once connected, RPC commands like `querydominfo` retrieve domain information and confirm NULL session access.

**Using rpcclient:**
```
$ rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5

rpcclient $> querydominfo
Domain:		INLANEFREIGHT
Server:

```

**Obtaining the Password Policy using rpcclient:**

**Using enum4linux:**

[enum4linux](https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux/) is a tool built around the [Samba suite of tools](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/samba.7.html) `nmblookup`, `net`, `rpcclient` and `smbclient` to use for enumeration of windows hosts and domains. It can be found pre-installed on many different penetration testing distros. Below we have an example output displaying information that can be provided by `enum4linux`. Here are some common enumeration tools and the ports they use:

|Tool	|Ports|
|-|-|
|nmblookup|	137/UDP|
|nbtstat|	137/UDP|
|net	|139/TCP, 135/TCP, TCP and UDP 135 and 49152-65535|
|rpcclient|	135/TCP|
|smbclient|	445/TCP|

```
$ enum4linux -P 172.16.5.5

## Enumerating Null Session - from Windows

It is less common to do this type of null session attack from Windows, but we could use the command `net use \\host\ipc$ "" /u:""` to establish a null session from a windows machine and confirm if we can perform more of this type of attack.
```
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "" /u:""
The command completed successfully.
```

We can also use a username/password combination to attempt to connect. Let's see some common errors when trying to authenticate:

**Error: Account is Disabled**
```
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "" /u:guest
System error 1331 has occurred.

This user can't sign in because this account is currently disabled.
```

**Error: Password is Incorrect**
```
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "password" /u:guest
System error 1326 has occurred.

The user name or password is incorrect.
```

**Error: Account is locked out (Password Policy)**
```
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "password" /u:guest
System error 1909 has occurred.

The referenced account is currently locked out and may not be logged on to.
```

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - LDAP Anonymous Bind

[LDAP anonymous binds](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/active-directory/anonymous-ldap-operations-active-directory-disabled) allow unauthenticated attackers to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. This is a legacy configuration, and as of Windows Server 2003, only authenticated users are permitted to initiate LDAP requests. We still see this configuration from time to time as an admin may have needed to set up a particular application to allow anonymous binds and given out more than the intended amount of access, thereby giving unauthenticated users access to all objects in AD.

With an LDAP anonymous bind, we can use LDAP-specific enumeration tools such as `windapsearch.py`, `ldapsearch`, `ad-ldapdomaindump.py`, etc., to pull the password policy. With [ldapsearch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch), it can be a bit cumbersome but doable. One example command to get the password policy is as follows:

**Using ldapsearch:**
```
$ ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "*" | grep -m 1 -B 10 pwdHistoryLength

forceLogoff: -9223372036854775808
lockoutDuration: -18000000000
lockOutObservationWindow: -18000000000
lockoutThreshold: 5
maxPwdAge: -9223372036854775808
minPwdAge: -864000000000
minPwdLength: 8
modifiedCountAtLastProm: 0
nextRid: 1002
pwdProperties: 1
pwdHistoryLength: 24
```

- Here we can see the minimum password length of 8, lockout threshold of 5, and password complexity is set (`pwdProperties` set to `1`).

## Enumerating the Password Policy - from Windows

If we can authenticate to the domain from a Windows host, we can use built-in Windows binaries such as net.exe to retrieve the password policy. We can also use various tools such as PowerView, CrackMapExec ported to Windows, SharpMapExec, SharpView, etc.

Using built-in commands is helpful if we land on a Windows system and cannot transfer tools to it, or we are positioned on a Windows system by the client, but have no way of getting tools onto it. One example using the built-in net.exe binary is:

**Using net.exe:**
```
C:\htb> net accounts

Force user logoff how long after time expires?:       Never
Minimum password age (days):                          1
Maximum password age (days):                          Unlimited
Minimum password length:                              8
Length of password history maintained:                24
Lockout threshold:                                    5
Lockout duration (minutes):                           30
Lockout observation window (minutes):                 30
Computer role:                                        SERVER
The command completed successfully.
```

Here we can glean the following information:
- Passwords never expire (Maximum password age set to Unlimited)
- The minimum password length is 8 so weak passwords are likely in use
- The lockout threshold is 5 wrong passwords
- Accounts remained locked out for 30 minutes

This password policy is excellent for password spraying. The eight-character minimum means that we can try common weak passwords such as `Welcome1`. The lockout threshold of 5 means that we can attempt 2-3 (to be safe) sprays every 31 minutes without the risk of locking out any accounts. If an account has been locked out, it will automatically unlock (without manual intervention from an admin) after 30 minutes, but we should avoid locking out `ANY` accounts at all costs.

`PowerView` is also quite handy for this:

**Using PowerView**
```
PS C:\htb> import-module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainPolicy

Unicode        : @{Unicode=yes}
SystemAccess   : @{MinimumPasswordAge=1; MaximumPasswordAge=-1; MinimumPasswordLength=8; PasswordComplexity=1;
                 PasswordHistorySize=24; LockoutBadCount=5; ResetLockoutCount=30; LockoutDuration=30;
                 RequireLogonToChangePassword=0; ForceLogoffWhenHourExpire=0; ClearTextPassword=0;
                 LSAAnonymousNameLookup=0}
KerberosPolicy : @{MaxTicketAge=10; MaxRenewAge=7; MaxServiceAge=600; MaxClockSkew=5; TicketValidateClient=1}
Version        : @{signature="$CHICAGO$"; Revision=1}
RegistryValues : @{MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\NoLMHash=System.Object[]}
Path           : \\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\sysvol\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\Policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\MACHI
                 NE\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf
GPOName        : {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}
GPODisplayName : Default Domain Policy
```

PowerView gave us the same output as our `net accounts` command, just in a different format but also revealed that password complexity is enabled (`PasswordComplexity=1`).

# Password Spraying - Making a Target User List

## Detailed User Enumeration

For successful password spraying, we need a list of valid domain users. Gathering methods include:

* SMB NULL sessions to retrieve complete user lists from the domain controller
* LDAP anonymous binds to query and pull domain users
* Tools like `Kerbrute` with wordlists from sources like statistically-likely-usernames GitHub repo or linkedin2username
* Using credentials (client-provided or obtained via LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning with `Responder` or previous password sprays)

**Understanding the password policy is critical.** With SMB NULL sessions, LDAP anonymous binds, or valid credentials, we can enumerate it. The policy reveals minimum password length, complexity requirements, account lockout threshold, and bad password timer—informing how many spray attempts we can make without causing lockouts and wait times between attempts.

Without the password policy, we can request it from the client. If unavailable, options include one targeted "hail mary" attempt or spacing sprays hours apart to avoid lockouts.

**Always maintain detailed logs:**
* Targeted accounts
* Domain Controller used
* Time and date of sprays
* Passwords attempted

This prevents duplicate efforts and helps investigate any account lockouts or suspicious activity by crosschecking with client logging systems.

## SMB NULL Session to Pull User List

Without valid domain credentials on an internal machine, look for SMB NULL sessions or LDAP anonymous binds on Domain Controllers to obtain complete user lists and password policies. With existing domain credentials or `SYSTEM` access on a Windows host, you can directly query Active Directory.

The SYSTEM account works because it can `impersonate` the computer object, which is treated as a domain user account (with some differences, like authenticating across forest trusts).

If no valid domain account exists and SMB NULL sessions/LDAP anonymous binds aren't possible, create a user list using external resources like email harvesting and LinkedIn. While incomplete, this may still provide sufficient access to Active Directory.

Some tools that can leverage SMB NULL sessions and LDAP anonymous binds include `enum4linux`, `rpcclient`, and `CrackMapExec`, among others. Regardless of the tool, we'll have to do a bit of filtering to clean up the output and obtain a list of only usernames, one on each line. We can do this with `enum4linux` with the `-U` flag.

**Using enum4linux:**
```
[!bash!]$ enum4linux -U 172.16.5.5  | grep "user:" | cut -f2 -d"[" | cut -f1 -d"]"

administrator
guest
krbtgt
lab_adm
htb-student
avazquez
pfalcon
fanthony
wdillard
lbradford
sgage
asanchez
dbranch
ccruz
njohnson
mholliday

<SNIP>
```

We can use the `enumdomusers` command after connecting anonymously using `rpcclient`.

**Using rpcclient:**
```
[!bash!]$ rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5

rpcclient $> enumdomusers 
user:[administrator] rid:[0x1f4]
user:[guest] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[krbtgt] rid:[0x1f6]
user:[lab_adm] rid:[0x3e9]
user:[htb-student] rid:[0x457]
user:[avazquez] rid:[0x458]

<SNIP>
```

Finally, we can use `CrackMapExec` with the `--users` flag. This is a useful tool that will also show the `badpwdcount` (invalid login attempts), so we can remove any accounts from our list that are close to the lockout threshold. It also shows the `baddpwdtime`, which is the date and time of the last bad password attempt, so we can see how close an account is to having its `badpwdcount` reset. 

In an environment with multiple Domain Controllers, this value is maintained separately on each one. To get an accurate total of the account's bad password attempts, we would have to either query each Domain Controller and use the sum of the values or query the Domain Controller with the PDC Emulator FSMO role.

**Using CrackMapExec --users Flag**
```
[!bash!]$ crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 --users

## Gathering Users with LDAP Anonymous

We can use various tools to gather users when we find an LDAP anonymous bind. Some examples include [windapsearch](https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch) and [ldapsearch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch). If we choose to use `ldapsearch` we will need to specify a valid LDAP search filter.

**Using ldapsearch**
```
[!bash!]$ ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "(&(objectclass=user))"  | grep sAMAccountName: | cut -f2 -d" "

guest

ACADEMY-EA-WEB01$
htb-student
avazquez
pfalcon
fanthony
wdillard
lbradford
sgage
asanchez
dbranch

<SNIP>
```

Tools such as `windapsearch` make this easier (though we should still understand how to create our own LDAP search filters). Here we can specify anonymous access by providing a blank username with the `-u` flag and the `-U` flag to tell the tool to retrieve just users.
```
[!bash!]$ ./windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u "" -U

## Enumerating Users with Kerbrute

When lacking network access, `Kerbrute` can enumerate valid AD accounts and perform password spraying using **Kerberos Pre-Authentication**—a faster and potentially stealthier method that doesn't generate **Windows event ID 4625** (logon failure), which is commonly monitored.

The tool sends TGT requests to the domain controller without Kerberos Pre-Authentication for username enumeration. If the KDC responds with `PRINCIPAL UNKNOWN`, the username is invalid. When the KDC prompts for Kerberos Pre-Authentication, the username is valid. This enumeration method doesn't cause logon failures or account lockouts.

**However**, when switching to password spraying with this tool, failed Kerberos Pre-Authentication attempts **do** count toward failed login attempts and can cause account lockouts. Exercise caution regardless of the method used.

The [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo is an excellent resource for this type of attack and contains a variety of different username lists that we can use to enumerate valid usernames using `Kerbrute`.

**Kerbrute User Enumeration:**
```
[!bash!]$  kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt 

    __             __               __     
   / /_____  _____/ /_  _______  __/ /____

/_/|_|\___/_/  /_.___/_/   \__,_/\__/\___/

Using Kerbrute for username enumeration will generate event ID `4768: A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT)` was requested. This will only be triggered if `Kerberos event logging` is **enabled** via Group Policy. Defenders can tune their SIEM tools to look for an influx of this event ID, which may indicate an attack. If we are successful with this method during a penetration test, this can be an excellent recommendation to add to our report.

If we are unable to create a valid username list using any of the methods highlighted above, we could turn back to external information gathering and search for company email addresses or use a tool such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to mash up possible usernames from a company's LinkedIn page.

## Credentialed Enumeration to Build our User List

With valid credentials, we can use any of the tools stated previously to build a user list. A quick and easy way is using CrackMapExec.

**Using CrackMapExec with Valid Credentials:**
```
[!bash!]$ sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u htb-student -p Academy_student_AD! --users

[sudo] password for htb-student:
