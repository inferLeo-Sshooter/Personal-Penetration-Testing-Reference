# Credentialed Enumeration - from Windows

This section covers enumeration from a Windows attack host using tools like SharpHound/BloodHound, PowerView/SharpView, Grouper2, Snaffler, and built-in utilities. Some gathered data may serve reporting purposes rather than direct attack paths. Depending on assessment scope, clients may want all findings documented—including the ability to run BloodHound freely or specific user account attributes—as medium-risk findings or appendix items. Not every discovery needs to advance attacks; informational findings can still improve the client's security posture.

**Enumeration objectives:**
- Identify misconfigurations and permission issues enabling lateral/vertical movement
- Map domain architecture: domain trusts within and outside the current forest
- Pillage accessible file shares for sensitive data (e.g., credentials) to expand access

## ActiveDirectory PowerShell Module

When landing on a Windows host in the domain, especially one an admin uses, there is a chance you will find valuable tools and scripts on the host.

The [ActiveDirectory PowerShell module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/?view=windowsserver2022-ps) is a group of PowerShell cmdlets for administering an Active Directory environment from the command line. We can't cover them all here, but we will look at a few that are particularly useful for enumerating AD environments.

Before we can utilize the module, we have to make sure it is imported first. The `Get-Module` cmdlet, which is part of the `Microsoft.PowerShell.Core` module, will list all available modules, their version, and potential commands for use. This is a great way to see if anything like Git or custom administrator scripts are installed. If the module is not loaded, run `Import-Module ActiveDirectory` to load it for use.

**Discover Modules:**
```
PS C:\htb> Get-Module

ModuleType Version    Name                                ExportedCommands
---------- -------    ----                                ----------------
Manifest   3.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility        {Add-Member, Add-Type, Clear-Variable, Compare-Object...}
Script     2.0.0      PSReadline                          {Get-PSReadLineKeyHandler, Get-PSReadLineOption, Remove-PS...
```

We'll see that the ActiveDirectory module is not yet imported. Let's go ahead and import it.

**Load ActiveDirectory Module:**
```
PS C:\htb> Import-Module ActiveDirectory
PS C:\htb> Get-Module

ModuleType Version    Name                                ExportedCommands

Manifest   1.0.1.0    ActiveDirectory                     {Add-ADCentralAccessPolicyMember, Add-ADComputerServiceAcc...
Manifest   3.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility        {Add-Member, Add-Type, Clear-Variable, Compare-Object...}

```

Now that our modules are loaded, let's begin. First up, we'll enumerate some basic information about the domain with the `Get-ADDomain` cmdlet.

### Get Domain Info

```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADDomain

                                     DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL,

UsersContainer                     : CN=Users,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
```

This will print out helpful information like the domain SID, domain functional level, any child domains, and more. Next, we'll use the `Get-ADUser` cmdlet. We will be filtering for accounts with the `ServicePrincipalName` property populated. This will get us a listing of accounts that may be susceptible to a Kerberoasting attack, which we will cover in-depth after the next section.

### Get-ADUser
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrincipalName

DistinguishedName    : CN=adfs,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
Enabled              : True

```

Another interesting check we can run utilizing the ActiveDirectory module, would be to verify domain trust relationships using the `Get-ADTrust` cmdlet

### Checking For Trust Relationships

```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADTrust -Filter *

Direction               : BiDirectional
DisallowTransivity      : False

UsesRC4Encryption       : False
```

This cmdlet will print out any trust relationships the domain has. We can determine if they are trusts within our forest or with domains in other forests, the type of trust, the direction of the trust, and the name of the domain the relationship is with. This will be useful later on when looking to take advantage of child-to-parent trust relationships and attacking across forest trusts. Next, we can gather AD group information using the `Get-ADGroup` cmdlet.

### Group Enumeration

```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup -Filter * | select name

name
----
Administrators
Users
Guests
Print Operators
Backup Operators
Replicator
Remote Desktop Users
Network Configuration Operators
Performance Monitor Users
Performance Log Users
Distributed COM Users
IIS_IUSRS
Cryptographic Operators
Event Log Readers
Certificate Service DCOM Access
RDS Remote Access Servers
RDS Endpoint Servers
RDS Management Servers
Hyper-V Administrators
Access Control Assistance Operators
Remote Management Users
Storage Replica Administrators
Domain Computers
Domain Controllers
Schema Admins
Enterprise Admins
Cert Publishers
Domain Admins

<SNIP>
```

We can take the results and feed interesting names back into the cmdlet to get more detailed information about a particular group like so:

### Detailed Group Info

```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup -Identity "Backup Operators"

DistinguishedName : CN=Backup Operators,CN=Builtin,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
GroupCategory     : Security
GroupScope        : DomainLocal
Name              : Backup Operators
ObjectClass       : group
ObjectGUID        : 6276d85d-9c39-4b7c-8449-cad37e8abc38
SamAccountName    : Backup Operators
SID               : S-1-5-32-551
```

Now that we know more about the group, let's get a member listing using the `Get-ADGroupMember` cmdlet.

### Group Membership
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Backup Operators"

distinguishedName : CN=BACKUPAGENT,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
name              : BACKUPAGENT
objectClass       : user
objectGUID        : 2ec53e98-3a64-4706-be23-1d824ff61bed
SamAccountName    : backupagent
SID               : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-5220
```

We can see that one account, `backupagent`, belongs to this group. It is worth noting this down because if we can take over this service account through some attack, we could use its membership in the Backup Operators group to take over the domain. We can perform this process for the other groups to fully understand the domain membership setup. Try repeating the process with a few different groups. You will see that this process can be tedious, and we will be left with an enormous amount of data to sift through. We must know how to do this with built-in tools such as the ActiveDirectory PowerShell module, but we will see later in this section just how much tools like BloodHound can speed up this process and make our results far more accurate and organized.

Utilizing the ActiveDirectory module on a host can be a stealthier way of performing actions than dropping a tool onto a host or loading it into memory and attempting to use it. This way, our actions could potentially blend in more.

## PowerView

PowerView is a PowerShell-based tool for gaining situational awareness in AD environments. Similar to BloodHound, it identifies user login locations, enumerates domain information (users, computers, groups, ACLs, trusts), hunts for file shares and passwords, performs Kerberoasting, and more. 

This highly versatile tool provides deep insight into domain security posture. While requiring more manual analysis than BloodHound to identify misconfigurations and relationships, PowerView can uncover subtle issues when used effectively.

Let's examine some of PowerView's capabilities and see what data it returns. The table below describes some of the most useful functions PowerView offers.

| Command | Description |

| `Get-DomainForeignGroupMember` | Enumerates groups with users outside of the group's domain and returns each foreign member |
| `Get-DomainTrustMapping` | Will enumerate all trusts for the current domain and any others seen |


This table is not all-encompassing for what PowerView offers, but it includes many of the functions we will use repeatedly.

First up is the `Get-DomainUser` function. This will provide us with information on all users or specific users we specify. Below we will use it to grab information about a specific user, `mmorgan`.

### Domain User Information

```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity mmorgan -Domain inlanefreight.local | Select-Object -Property name,samaccountname,description,memberof,whencreated,pwdlastset,lastlogontimestamp,accountexpires,admincount,userprincipalname,serviceprincipalname,useraccountcontrol

useraccountcontrol   : NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD, DONT_REQ_PREAUTH
```

We saw some basic user information with PowerView. Now let's enumerate some domain group information. We can use the `Get-DomainGroupMember` function to retrieve group-specific information. Adding the `-Recurse` switch tells PowerView that if it finds any groups that are part of the target group (nested group membership) to list out the members of those groups. For example, the output below shows that the `Secadmins` group is part of the `Domain Admins` group through nested group membership. In this case, we will be able to view all of the members of that group who inherit Domain Admin rights via their group membership.

### Recursive Group Membership

```
PS C:\htb>  Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recurse

GroupDomain             : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
GroupName               : Domain Admins

<SNIP>
```

Above we performed a recursive look at the `Domain Admins` group to list its members. Now we know who to target for potential elevation of privileges. Like with the AD PowerShell module, we can also enumerate domain trust mappings.

### Trust Enumeration

```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainTrustMapping

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : WITHIN_FOREST
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 6:20:22 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : FOREST_TRANSITIVE
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional

WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 6:20:22 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM
```

We can use the `Test-AdminAccess` function to test for local admin access on either the current machine or a remote one.

### Testing for Local Admin Access

```
PS C:\htb> Test-AdminAccess -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01

ComputerName    IsAdmin
------------    -------
ACADEMY-EA-MS01    True
```

Above, we determined that the user we are currently using is an administrator on the host ACADEMY-EA-MS01. We can perform the same function for each host to see where we have administrative access. We will see later how well BloodHound performs this type of check. Now we can check for users with the SPN attribute set, which indicates that the account may be subjected to a Kerberoasting attack.

### Finding Users With SPN Set

## SharpView

PowerView is part of the deprecated PowerSploit toolkit but continues receiving updates from BC-Security within their Empire 4 framework—an actively maintained fork of the original Empire project (as of April 2022). 

This module uses the development version of PowerView due to its excellent AD reconnaissance capabilities and continued effectiveness in modern networks despite the original being unmaintained. The BC-Security version adds new functions like `Get-NetGmsa` for hunting Group Managed Service Accounts (outside this module's scope). It's worth exploring both versions to understand the differences between the legacy and maintained releases.

Another tool worth experimenting with is SharpView, a .NET port of PowerView. Many of the same functions supported by PowerView can be used with SharpView. We can type a method name with `-Help` to get an argument list.

```
PS C:\htb> .\SharpView.exe Get-DomainUser -Help

Get_DomainUser -Identity <String[]> -DistinguishedName <String[]> -SamAccountName <String[]> -Name <String[]> -MemberDistinguishedName <String[]> -MemberName <String[]> -SPN <Boolean> -AdminCount <Boolean> -AllowDelegation <Boolean> -DisallowDelegation <Boolean> -TrustedToAuth <Boolean> -PreauthNotRequired <Boolean> -KerberosPreauthNotRequired <Boolean> -NoPreauth <Boolean> -Domain <String> -LDAPFilter <String> -Filter <String> -Properties <String[]> -SearchBase <String> -ADSPath <String> -Server <String> -DomainController <String> -SearchScope <SearchScope> -ResultPageSize <Int32> -ServerTimeLimit <Nullable`1> -SecurityMasks <Nullable`1> -Tombstone <Boolean> -FindOne <Boolean> -ReturnOne <Boolean> -Credential <NetworkCredential> -Raw <Boolean> -UACFilter <UACEnum>
```

Here we can use SharpView to enumerate information about a specific user, such as the user `forend`, which we control.

```
PS C:\htb> .\SharpView.exe Get-DomainUser -Identity forend

## Shares

Domain shares enable users to access role-relevant information and share organizational content. Properly configured shares require domain authentication and enforce permissions limiting access to only what's necessary for users' roles. 

Overly permissive shares risk accidentally exposing sensitive data (medical, legal, HR, personnel, etc.). Compromising a standard domain user with access to IT/infrastructure shares could reveal configuration files, SSH keys, or insecurely stored passwords. Identifying these issues ensures customers don't expose unnecessary data, meet job role requirements, and comply with regulations (HIPAA, PCI, etc.).

PowerView can hunt for shares and aid investigation, or manual commands can search for common strings (e.g., files containing `pass`). This process can be tedious and prone to oversights, especially in large environments. Now, let's take some time to explore the tool `Snaffler` and see how it can aid us in identifying these issues more accurately and efficiently.

---

## Snaffler

Snaffler acquires credentials and sensitive data in AD environments. It obtains a domain host list, enumerates shares and readable directories, then iterates through accessible directories hunting for files that could advance assessment progress. Snaffler must run from a domain-joined host or within a domain-user context.

### Snaffler Execution
```
Snaffler.exe -s -d inlanefreight.local -o snaffler.log -v data
```

**Parameters:**
- `-s`: Print results to console
- `-d`: Specify domain to search
- `-o`: Write results to logfile
- `-v`: Verbosity level (`data` displays only results, making output easier to review)

Snaffler generates substantial data, so output to file and review later. Raw output can also serve as supplemental client data during penetration tests, helping them prioritize securing high-value shares.

### Snaffler in Action

```
PS C:\htb> .\Snaffler.exe  -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -s -v data

We may find passwords, SSH keys, configuration files, or other data that can be used to further our access. Snaffler color codes the output for us and provides us with a rundown of the file types found in the shares.

Now that we have a wealth of data about the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain (and hopefully clear notes and log file output!), we need a way to correlate it and visualize it. Let's dive deeper into `BloodHound` and see how powerful this tool can be during any AD-focused security assessment.

---

## BloodHound

`Bloodhound` is an exceptional open-source tool that can identify attack paths within an AD environment by analyzing the relationships between objects. Both penetration testers and blue teamers can benefit from learning to use BloodHound to visualize relationships in the domain. When used correctly and coupled with custom Cipher queries, BloodHound may find high-impact, but difficult to discover, flaws that have been present in the domain for years.

First, we must authenticate as a domain user from a Windows attack host positioned within the network (but not joined to the domain) or transfer the tool to a domain-joined host. For our purposes, we will work with SharpHound.exe already on the attack host.

If we run SharpHound with the `--help` option, we can see the options available to us.

```
PS C:\htb>  .\SharpHound.exe --help

We'll start by running the SharpHound.exe collector from the MS01 attack host.

**BloodHound Analysis**

Run SharpHound.exe collector from MS01, then exfiltrate the dataset or ingest it into BloodHound GUI on MS01 by typing `bloodhound` in CMD/PowerShell. Use credentials `neo4j: HTB_@cademy_stdnt!` if prompted. Click `Upload Data`, select the zip file, and click `Open`. Once all .json files reach 100% in the Upload Progress window, close it.

Search `domain:` and select `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`. The Node Info tab reveals a large environment with 550+ hosts and trusts with two other domains.

**Analysis Tab - Pre-built Queries:**

The `Find Computers with Unsupported Operating Systems` query identifies outdated systems running legacy software—common in enterprise networks due to irreplaceable products. While cost-effective, these hosts introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., MS08-067 on older systems). Exercise caution when targeting them, as they may be fragile or run critical applications. Verify with clients before attacking.

**Recommendations:**
- Segment unsupported hosts from the network if removal isn't feasible
- Develop decommission and replacement plans

This query shows two hosts (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008)—potentially inactive. Always validate if hosts are "live" before reporting. Document as high-risk findings (Legacy Operating Systems) or best practices (AD record cleanup).

**Local Admin Rights Enumeration**

Users often retain local admin rights unnecessarily—granted temporarily for software installation and never removed, or assigned based on organizational role rather than actual need. Common scenarios include:
- Excessive rights across IT departments (local admin over server groups or entire infrastructure)
- Domain Users group with local admin on one or more hosts

Compromising accounts with these rights provides access to multiple machines for credential harvesting from memory or discovering sensitive data.

**BloodHound Query:**
Run `Find Computers where Domain Users are Local Admin` to identify hosts where all users have local admin. Any controlled account can typically access these hosts for exploitation.

**Local Admins**
