# Enumerating Security Controls

After establishing a foothold, use this access to assess host defenses, conduct deeper domain enumeration with reduced restrictions, and leverage native tools for "living off the land" operations. Understanding an organization's security controls is crucial, as deployed products influence AD enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation tool choices. Knowledge of defensive measures helps inform decisions on tool selection and usage, enabling us to avoid detection or modify tools accordingly. Security controls often vary across organizations and may be inconsistently applied—some machines may have stricter policies affecting enumeration while others remain less protected.

## Windows Defender

Windows Defender (Microsoft Defender post-May 2020 Update) has significantly improved and blocks tools like `PowerView` by default. Bypass techniques exist and are covered in other modules. Use the built-in cmdlet `Get-MpComputerStatus` to check Defender status. If `RealTimeProtectionEnabled` is `True`, Defender is active on the system.

**Checking the Status of Defender with Get-MpComputerStatus:**

## AppLocker

An application whitelist controls which approved software can run on a system, protecting against malware and unauthorized applications. AppLocker is Microsoft's whitelisting solution, giving administrators granular control over executables, scripts, installer files, DLLs, and packaged apps. Organizations commonly block `cmd.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`, and write access to certain directories, but these restrictions can be bypassed. 

A frequent oversight is blocking only `PowerShell.exe` while ignoring alternative locations like `%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` or `PowerShell_ISE.exe`. For example, if AppLocker blocks `%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` for Domain Users, PowerShell can simply be executed from alternate locations. More stringent AppLocker policies require additional creativity to bypass, covered in other modules.

**Using Get-AppLockerPolicy cmdlet:**
```
PS C:\htb> Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections

## PowerShell Constrained Language Mode

`PowerShell Constrained Language Mode` locks down many of the features needed to use PowerShell effectively, such as blocking COM objects, only allowing approved .NET types, XAML-based workflows, PowerShell classes, and more. We can quickly enumerate whether we are in Full Language Mode or Constrained Language Mode.

**Enumerating Language Mode:**
```
PS C:\htb> $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode

ConstrainedLanguage
```

## LAPS

Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) randomizes and rotates local administrator passwords on Windows hosts to prevent lateral movement. We can enumerate which domain users have read access to LAPS passwords and identify machines without LAPS installed. 

The [LAPSToolkit](https://github.com/leoloobeek/LAPSToolkit) simplifies this through functions like parsing `ExtendedRights` for LAPS-enabled computers, revealing groups delegated to read LAPS passwords (often protected groups). Accounts that joined a computer to the domain receive `All Extended Rights` over that host, granting LAPS password read access. Enumeration may identify specific AD users with this capability, helping us target accounts that can read LAPS passwords.

**Using Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups:**
```
PS C:\htb> Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups

OrgUnit                                             Delegated Groups

```

The `Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights` checks the rights on each computer with LAPS enabled for any groups with read access and users with "All Extended Rights." Users with "All Extended Rights" can read LAPS passwords and may be less protected than users in delegated groups, so this is worth checking for.

**Using Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights:**
```
PS C:\htb> Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights

ComputerName                Identity                    Reason
------------                --------                    ------

WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated
```

We can use the `Get-LAPSComputers` function to search for computers that have LAPS enabled when passwords expire, and even the randomized passwords in cleartext if our user has access.

**Using Get-LAPSComputers:**
```
PS C:\htb> Get-LAPSComputers

# Credentialed Enumeration - from Linux

Assuming now that we have acquired a foothold in the domain, it is time to dig deeper using our low privilege domain user credentials. Since we have a general idea about the domain's userbase and machines, it's time to enumerate the domain in depth. We are interested in information about domain user and computer attributes, group membership, Group Policy Objects, permissions, ACLs, trusts, and more. We have various options available, but the most important thing to remember is that most of these tools will not work without valid domain user credentials at any permission level. So at a minimum, we will have to have acquired a user's cleartext password, NTLM password hash, or SYSTEM access on a domain-joined host.

## CrackMapExec

CrackMapExec (CME, now NetExec) is a powerful toolset to help with assessing AD environments. It utilizes packages from the Impacket and PowerSploit toolkits to perform its functions.

CME offers a help menu for each protocol (i.e., `crackmapexec winrm -h`, etc.). Be sure to review the entire help menu and all possible options. For now, the flags we are interested in are:
- `-u` Username `The user whose credentials we will use to authenticate`
- `-p` Password `User's password`
- Target (IP or FQDN) `Target host to enumerate` (in our case, the Domain Controller)
- `--users` `Specifies to enumerate Domain Users`
- `--groups` `Specifies to enumerate domain groups`
- `--loggedon-users` `Attempts to enumerate what users are logged on to a target, if any`
We'll start by using the SMB protocol to enumerate users and groups. We will target the Domain Controller (whose address we uncovered earlier) because it holds all data in the domain database that we are interested in. Make sure you preface all commands with `sudo`.

### CME - Domain User Enumeration

We start by pointing CME at the Domain Controller and using the credentials for the user we got to retrieve a list of all domain users. Notice when it provides us the user information, it includes data points such as the [badPwdCount](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-badpwdcount) attribute. This is helpful when performing actions like targeted password spraying. We could build a target user list filtering out any users with their `badPwdCount` attribute above 0 to be extra careful not to lock any accounts out.

The above snippet lists the groups within the domain and the number of users in each. The output also shows the built-in groups on the Domain Controller, such as `Backup Operators`. We can begin to note down groups of interest. Take note of key groups like `Administrators`, `Domain Admins`, `Executives`, any groups that may contain privileged IT admins, etc. These groups will likely contain users with elevated privileges worth targeting during our assessment.

### CME - Logged On Users

We can also use CME to target other hosts. Let's check out what appears to be a file server to see what users are logged in currently.

```
$ sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.130 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --loggedon-users

SMB         172.16.5.130    445    ACADEMY-EA-FILE  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-FILE) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)

SMB         172.16.5.130    445    ACADEMY-EA-FILE  INLANEFREIGHT\lab_adm                   logon_server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01
SMB         172.16.5.130    445    ACADEMY-EA-FILE  INLANEFREIGHT\svc_qualys                logon_server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01
SMB         172.16.5.130    445    ACADEMY-EA-FILE  INLANEFREIGHT\wley                      logon_server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01

<SNIP>
```

We see that many users are logged into this server which is very interesting. We can also see that our user `forend` is a local admin because (`Pwn3d!`) appears after the tool successfully authenticates to the target host. A host like this may be used as a jump host or similar by administrative users. We can see that the user `svc_qualys` is logged in, who we earlier identified as a domain admin. It could be an easy win if we can steal this user's credentials from memory or impersonate them.

### CME Share Searching

We can use the `--shares` flag to enumerate available shares on the remote host and the level of access our user account has to each share (READ or WRITE access). Let's run this against the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL Domain Controller.
```
$ sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --shares

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  C$                              Default share
SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  Department Shares READ            
SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  IPC$            READ            Remote IPC
SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  NETLOGON        READ            Logon server share 
SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  SYSVOL          READ            Logon server share 
SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  User Shares     READ            
SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  ZZZ_archive     READ
```

We see several shares available to us with `READ` access. The `Department Shares`, `User Shares`, and `ZZZ_archive` shares would be worth digging into further as they may contain sensitive data such as passwords or PII. Next, we can dig into the shares and spider each directory looking for files. The module `spider_plus` will dig through each readable share on the host and list all readable files. Let's give it a try.

```
$ sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M spider_plus --share 'Department Shares'

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\forend:Klmcargo2 
SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Started spidering plus with option:
SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*]        DIR: ['print$']
SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*]        EXT: ['ico', 'lnk']
SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*]       SIZE: 51200
SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*]     OUTPUT: /tmp/cme_spider_plus
```

In the above command, we ran the spider against the `Department Shares`. When completed, CME writes the results to a JSON file located at `/tmp/cme_spider_plus/<ip of host>`. Below we can see a portion of the JSON output. We could dig around for interesting files such as `web.config` files or scripts that may contain passwords. If we wanted to dig further, we could pull those files to see what all resides within, perhaps finding some hardcoded credentials or other sensitive information.

```
$ head -n 10 /tmp/cme_spider_plus/172.16.5.5.json 

{
    "Department Shares": {
        "Accounting/Private/AddSelect.bat": {
            "atime_epoch": "2022-03-31 14:44:42",
            "ctime_epoch": "2022-03-31 14:44:39",
            "mtime_epoch": "2022-03-31 15:14:46",
            "size": "278 Bytes"
        },
        "Accounting/Private/ApproveConnect.wmf": {

## SMBMap

SMBMap is a Linux tool for enumerating SMB shares. It lists shares, permissions, and contents (if accessible), and can download/upload files and execute remote commands once access is obtained.

Using domain credentials, SMBMap checks for accessible shares on remote systems. View options with `smbmap -h`. Beyond listing shares, it can recursively list directories, display directory contents, and search file contents—particularly useful when extracting information from shares.

### SMBMap To Check Access

```
$ smbmap -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.5.5

[+] IP: 172.16.5.5:445	Name: inlanefreight.local                               
        Disk                                                  	Permissions	Comment
	----                                                  	-----------	-------
	ADMIN$                                            	NO ACCESS	Remote Admin
	C$                                                	NO ACCESS	Default share
	Department Shares                                 	READ ONLY	
	IPC$                                              	READ ONLY	Remote IPC
	NETLOGON                                          	READ ONLY	Logon server share 
	SYSVOL                                            	READ ONLY	Logon server share 
	User Shares                                       	READ ONLY	
	ZZZ_archive                                       	READ ONLY
```

The above will tell us what our user can access and their permission levels. Like our results from CME, we see that the user `forend` has no access to the DC via the `ADMIN$` or `C$` shares (this is expected for a standard user account), but does have read access over `IPC$`, `NETLOGON`, and `SYSVOL` which is the default in any domain. The other non-standard shares, such as `Department Shares` and the user and archive shares, are most interesting. Let's do a recursive listing of the directories in the `Department Shares` share.

### Recursive List Of All Directories

```
$ smbmap -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.5.5 -R 'Department Shares' --dir-only

[+] IP: 172.16.5.5:445	Name: inlanefreight.local                               
        Disk                                                  	Permissions	Comment
	----                                                  	-----------	-------
	Department Shares                                 	READ ONLY	
	.\Department Shares\*

	dr--r--r--                0 Thu Mar 31 15:16:10 2022	Temp
	dr--r--r--                0 Thu Mar 31 15:16:18 2022	Warehouse

    <SNIP>
```

As the recursive listing dives deeper, it will show you the output of all subdirectories within the higher-level directories. The use of `--dir-only` provided only the output of all directories and did not list all files. Try this against other shares on the Domain Controller and see what you can find.

## rpcclient

rpcclient is a handy tool created for use with the Samba protocol and to provide extra functionality via MS-RPC. It can enumerate, add, change, and even remove objects from AD. It is highly versatile; we just have to find the correct command to issue for what we want to accomplish. The man page for rpcclient is very helpful for this; just type man rpcclient into your attack host's shell and review the options available. 

Due to SMB NULL sessions (covered in-depth in the password spraying sections) on some of our hosts, we can perform authenticated or unauthenticated enumeration using rpcclient in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain. An example of using rpcclient from an unauthenticated standpoint (if this configuration exists in our target domain) would be:

```
rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5
```

The above will provide us with a bound connection, and we should be greeted with a new prompt to start unleashing the power of rpcclient.

<img width="915" height="265" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c973084c-9cfa-4e8a-8752-0bb2237a80ba" />

From here, we can begin to enumerate any number of different things.

### rpcclient Enumeration

In rpcclient, each user has a `rid:` field. A Relative Identifier (RID) is a unique hexadecimal identifier Windows uses to track objects.

**How RIDs work:**
* Domain SID example: `S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114`
* When an object is created, the domain SID combines with a RID to form a unique identifier
* Example: User `htb-student` with RID `[0x457]` (decimal 1111) has full SID: `S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1111`
* This SID is unique to that object within the domain

**Consistent RIDs:**
Some accounts have fixed RIDs across all hosts. The built-in domain Administrator always has RID `[0x1f4]` (decimal 500). Since RIDs are unique to objects, they enable further enumeration of object information from the domain.

### RPCClient User Enumeration By RID

```
rpcclient $> queryuser 0x457

        User Name   :   htb-student
        Full Name   :   Htb Student
        Home Drive  :
        Dir Drive   :
        Profile Path:
        Logon Script:
        Description :

        Comment     :
        Remote Dial :
        Logon Time               :      Wed, 02 Mar 2022 15:34:32 EST
        Logoff Time              :      Wed, 31 Dec 1969 19:00:00 EST
        Kickoff Time             :      Wed, 13 Sep 30828 22:48:05 EDT
        Password last set Time   :      Wed, 27 Oct 2021 12:26:52 EDT
        Password can change Time :      Thu, 28 Oct 2021 12:26:52 EDT
        Password must change Time:      Wed, 13 Sep 30828 22:48:05 EDT
        unknown_2[0..31]...
        user_rid :      0x457
        group_rid:      0x201
        acb_info :      0x00000010
        fields_present: 0x00ffffff
        logon_divs:     168
        bad_password_count:     0x00000000
        logon_count:    0x0000001d
        padding1[0..7]...
        logon_hrs[0..21]...
```

When we searched for information using the `queryuser` command against the RID `0x457`, RPC returned the user information for `htb-student` as expected. This wasn't hard since we already knew the RID for `htb-student`. If we wished to enumerate all users to gather the RIDs for more than just one, we would use the `enumdomusers` command.

```
rpcclient $> enumdomusers

user:[administrator] rid:[0x1f4]
user:[guest] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[krbtgt] rid:[0x1f6]
user:[lab_adm] rid:[0x3e9]
user:[htb-student] rid:[0x457]
user:[avazquez] rid:[0x458]
user:[pfalcon] rid:[0x459]
user:[fanthony] rid:[0x45a]
user:[wdillard] rid:[0x45b]
user:[lbradford] rid:[0x45c]
user:[sgage] rid:[0x45d]
user:[asanchez] rid:[0x45e]
user:[dbranch] rid:[0x45f]
user:[ccruz] rid:[0x460]
user:[njohnson] rid:[0x461]
user:[mholliday] rid:[0x462]

<SNIP>
```

Using it in this manner will print out all domain users by name and RID. Our enumeration can go into great detail utilizing rpcclient.

## Impacket Toolkit

Impacket is a versatile toolkit that provides us with many different ways to enumerate, interact, and exploit Windows protocols and find the information we need using Python. The tool is actively maintained and has many contributors, especially when new attack techniques arise. We could perform many other actions with Impacket, but we will only highlight a few in this section; `wmiexec.py` and `psexec.py`. Earlier in the poisoning section, we grabbed a hash for the user `wley` with `Responder` and cracked it to obtain the password `transporter@4`. We will see in the next section that this user is a local admin on the `ACADEMY-EA-FILE` host. We will utilize the credentials for the next few actions.

### Psexec.py

The tool creates a remote service by uploading a randomly-named executable to the `ADMIN$` share on the target host. It then registers the service via `RPC` and the `Windows Service Control Manager`. Once established, communication happens over a named pipe, providing an interactive remote shell as `SYSTEM` on the victim host.

To connect to a host with psexec.py, we need credentials for a user with local administrator privileges.
```
psexec.py inlanefreight.local/wley:'transporter@4'@172.16.5.125
```

Once we execute the psexec module, it drops us into the `system32` directory on the target host. We ran the `whoami` command to verify, and it confirmed that we landed on the host as `SYSTEM`. From here, we can perform almost any task on this host; anything from further enumeration to persistence and lateral movement

### wmiexec.py

Wmiexec.py utilizes a semi-interactive shell where commands are executed through Windows Management Instrumentation. It does not drop any files or executables on the target host and generates fewer logs than other modules. After connecting, it runs as the local admin user we connected with (this can be less obvious to someone hunting for an intrusion than seeing SYSTEM executing many commands). This is a more stealthy approach to execution on hosts than other tools, but would still likely be caught by most modern anti-virus and EDR systems. We will use the same account as with psexec.py to access the host.

```
wmiexec.py inlanefreight.local/wley:'transporter@4'@172.16.5.5
```

Note that this shell environment is not fully interactive, so each command issued will execute a new cmd.exe from WMI and execute your command. The downside of this is that if a vigilant defender checks event logs and looks at event ID 4688: A new process has been created, they will see a new process created to spawn cmd.exe and issue a command. This isn't always malicious activity since many organizations utilize WMI to administer computers, but it can be a tip-off in an investigation.

## Windapsearch

Windapsearch is another handy Python script we can use to enumerate users, groups, and computers from a Windows domain by utilizing LDAP queries. It is present in our attack host's /opt/windapsearch/ directory.

```
$ windapsearch.py -h

usage: windapsearch.py [-h] [-d DOMAIN] [--dc-ip DC_IP] [-u USER]
                       [-p PASSWORD] [--functionality] [-G] [-U] [-C]
                       [-m GROUP_NAME] [--da] [--admin-objects] [--user-spns]
                       [--unconstrained-users] [--unconstrained-computers]
                       [--gpos] [-s SEARCH_TERM] [-l DN]
                       [--custom CUSTOM_FILTER] [-r] [--attrs ATTRS] [--full]
                       [-o output_dir]

We have several options with Windapsearch to perform standard enumeration (dumping users, computers, and groups) and more detailed enumeration. The `--da` (enumerate domain admins group members ) option and the `-PU` ( find privileged users) options. The `-PU` option is interesting because it will perform a recursive search for users with nested group membership.

### Windapsearch - Domain Admins

```
$ python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u forend@inlanefreight.local -p Klmcargo2 --da

[+] Using Domain Controller at: 172.16.5.5

cn: lab_adm

cn: Matthew Morgan
userPrincipalName: mmorgan@inlanefreight.local

<SNIP>
```

From the results in the shell above, we can see that it enumerated 28 users from the Domain Admins group. Take note of a few users we have already seen before and may even have a hash or cleartext password like `wley`, `svc_qualys`, and `lab_adm`.

To identify more potential users, we can run the tool with the `-PU` flag and check for users with elevated privileges that may have gone unnoticed. This is a great check for reporting since it will most likely inform the customer of users with excess privileges from nested group membership.

### Windapsearch - Privileged Users

$ python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u forend@inlanefreight.local -p Klmcargo2 -PU

## Bloodhound.py

[BloodHound](https://github.com/dirkjanm/BloodHound.py) is one of the most impactful Active Directory security auditing tools available and invaluable for penetration testers. It transforms large datasets into graphical "attack paths," revealing where user access may lead and exposing nuanced AD flaws that other tools would miss. Using graph theory, it visualizes relationships and uncovers difficult or impossible-to-detect attack paths.

**Components:**
- **Collectors (ingestors):** SharpHound (C# for Windows) or BloodHound.py (Python)
- **GUI tool:** Uploads collected JSON data and runs pre-built or custom [Cypher queries](https://specterops.io/blog/2017/09/18/bloodhound-intro-to-cypher/)

**Data collected:** Users, groups, computers, group membership, GPOs, ACLs, domain trusts, local admin access, user sessions, computer/user properties, RDP/WinRM access, etc.

**BloodHound.py advantages:**
The community-developed Python port (requiring Impacket, `ldap3`, and `dnspython`) enables collection from Linux attack hosts when lacking domain-joined Windows access. This avoids running collectors on domain hosts, reducing detection risk—though even remote execution may trigger alerts in well-protected environments.

```
$ bloodhound-python -h

usage: bloodhound-python [-h] [-c COLLECTIONMETHOD] [-u USERNAME]
                         [-p PASSWORD] [-k] [--hashes HASHES] [-ns NAMESERVER]
                         [--dns-tcp] [--dns-timeout DNS_TIMEOUT] [-d DOMAIN]
                         [-dc HOST] [-gc HOST] [-w WORKERS] [-v]
                         [--disable-pooling] [--disable-autogc] [--zip]

Python based ingestor for BloodHound
For help or reporting issues, visit https://github.com/Fox-IT/BloodHound.py

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c COLLECTIONMETHOD, --collectionmethod COLLECTIONMETHOD
                        Which information to collect. Supported: Group,
                        LocalAdmin, Session, Trusts, Default (all previous),
                        DCOnly (no computer connections), DCOM, RDP,PSRemote,
                        LoggedOn, ObjectProps, ACL, All (all except LoggedOn).
                        You can specify more than one by separating them with
                        a comma. (default: Default)
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        Username. Format: username[@domain]; If the domain is
                        unspecified, the current domain is used.
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        Password

  <SNIP>
```

As we can see the tool accepts various collection methods with the `-c` or `--collectionmethod` flag. We can retrieve specific data such as user sessions, users and groups, object properties, ACLS, or select `all` to gather as much data as possible. Let's run it this way.

### Executing BloodHound.py

```
$ sudo bloodhound-python -u 'forend' -p 'Klmcargo2' -ns 172.16.5.5 -d inlanefreight.local -c all 

INFO: Found AD domain: inlanefreight.local
INFO: Connecting to LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
INFO: Found 1 domains
INFO: Found 2 domains in the forest
INFO: Found 564 computers
INFO: Connecting to LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
INFO: Found 2951 users
INFO: Connecting to GC LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
INFO: Found 183 groups
INFO: Found 2 trusts
INFO: Starting computer enumeration with 10 workers

<SNIP>
```

The command above executed Bloodhound.py with the user `forend`. We specified our nameserver as the Domain Controller with the `-ns` flag and the domain, INLANEFREIGHt.LOCAL with the `-d` flag. The `-c all` flag told the tool to run all checks. Once the script finishes, we will see the output files in the current working directory in the format of <date_object.json>.

**Viewing the Results:**
```
$ ls

20220307163102_computers.json  20220307163102_domains.json  20220307163102_groups.json  20220307163102_users.json
```

**Upload the Zip File into the BloodHound GUI**

Start the neo4j service with `sudo neo4j start` to initialize the database for data loading and Cypher queries.

Launch the BloodHound GUI by typing `bloodhound` on your Linux attack host (when logged in via `freerdp`). If credentials are required, use:
* `user == neo4j` / `pass == HTB_@cademy_stdnt!`

**Uploading data:**
Once BloodHound opens with a blank interface, upload the collected data:
1. Optionally, zip all JSON files: `zip -r ilfreight_bh.zip *.json`
2. Click the `Upload Data` button (right side of window)
3. Select the zip file or individual JSON files
4. Click `Open`

Now that the data is loaded, we can use the Analysis tab to run queries against the database. These queries can be custom and specific to what you decide using [custom Cypher queries](https://hausec.com/2019/09/09/bloodhound-cypher-cheatsheet/). There are many great cheat sheets to help us here. As seen below, we can use the built-in `Path Finding` queries on the `Analysis tab` on the `Left` side of the window.

<img width="1809" height="1073" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67346ca7-f43a-49aa-b6f3-426b5ede7570" />

The `Find Shortest Paths To Domain Admins` query maps logical paths through users, groups, hosts, ACLs, GPOs, and their relationships that could enable privilege escalation to Domain Administrator. This is invaluable for planning lateral movement.

**Features to explore:**
- **Database Info tab:** Review uploaded data statistics
- **Node Info tab:** Search for nodes (e.g., `Domain Users`) and examine all available options
- **Analysis tab:** Use pre-built queries to quickly identify domain takeover paths
- **Raw Query box:** Experiment with custom Cypher queries from cheatsheets—paste queries at the bottom and hit enter
- **Settings menu:** Click the gear icon to adjust node/edge display, enable query debug mode, and toggle dark mode
